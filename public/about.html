<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Karthik Tekuri , currntly I am persuing my B.Tech 2nd year in B V Raju
  institute of Technology.I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and
  constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards. I am
  not comfortable with settling, and I am always looking for an opportunity to
  do better and achieve greatness.I am highly organised. I always take notes,
  and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to
  keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I am always able
  to find what I need. I find this increases efficiency and also helps the rest
  of the team stay on track. In my last role, I created a new filing process
  that increased departmental efficiency by 25 percent.

  I am a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives
  and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers,
  and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. I find this skill is
  especially helpful when kicking off projects with new clients. In my previous
  job, my client's customer satisfaction scores were 15 percent over the company
  average.
